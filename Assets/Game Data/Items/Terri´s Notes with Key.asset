  description: "__________________________________\nIf anyone reads this letter,
    I'm probably no longer in this world. Everyone here is crazy! Everyone just attacks
    everyone else, and that's only thanks to the abomination that consumes this world
    more and more every day. Oh mighty Torrak, stop it before we lose control and
    damn our existence!\n\r\nWhoever will be reading this piece of paper, here is
    the key. It's not much, but I hid a chest in a safe place with some rare items
    that might help. The problem is that there are crabs in the place... Lots of
    frustrated crabs. But it should still be far from contagion.\r\n \r\nA few meters
    away is a strange stone pillar, follow the path and you will come across a bridge.
    Move on and slowly descend from the hill still following the path towards the
    Aquatic biome. Accompanied by ancient tall trees, stay close to them and the
    shore, follow the waterway to the end. There is my treasure.\n\nIf the Highness
    can't help us, maybe you can handle it. Good luck.\n-Terri\r\n"
