  description: "__________________________________\nIf anyone reads this letter,
    I'm probably no longer in this world. Everyone here is crazy! Everyone just fights
    each other, and that's only thanks to the abomination that consumes this world
    every day. Oh mighty Torrak, stop it before we lose control and damn our existence!\n\r\nWhoever
    will be reading this piece of paper, here is the key. It's not much, but I hid
    a chest in a safe place with some rare items that might help. The problem is
    that there are crabs in the place... Lots of frustrated crabs. But it should
    still be far from contagion.\r\n \r\nMove out of the village towards the stone
    pillar and follow the path across the bridge. Descend from the hill following
    the path towards the Aquatic biome. Stay close to the ancient trees and the shore,
    follow the waterway to the end. There is my treasure.\n\nIf the Highness can't
    help us, maybe you can handle it. Good luck.\n\n-Terri\n__________________________________\nUse
