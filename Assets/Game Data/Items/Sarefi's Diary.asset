  description: '_________________________________

    It was indescribably exciting!
    Finally, my awaited moment came and I had the honor to touch the very soul of
    our world. The possibility to establish contact with him and communicate.


    These
    stones are a reflection of the life of our earth, and while I beat, let''s hope
    that the heart that keeps them alive with this eternal energy will be forever
    pure.


    I will hope that they heal the disaster that has been rumored lately.

    Ettein,
    soon you too will touch the Heartstone!
