  description: "If anyone reads this letter, I'm probably no longer in this world.
    Everyone here is crazy! Everyone just attacks everyone else, and that's only
    thanks to the abomination that consumes this world more and more every day. Oh
    mighty Torrak, stop it before we lose control and damn our existence!\n\r\nWhoever
    will be reading this piece of paper, here is the key. It's not much, but I hid
    a chest in a safe place with some rare items that might help. The problem is
    that there are crabs in the place... Lots of frustrated crabs. But it should
    still be far from contagion.\r\n \r\nA few meters away is a strange stone pillar,
    follow the path and you will come across a bridge. Move on and slowly descend
    from the mountains still following the path towards the water biome. Accompanied
    by ancient tall trees, stay close to them and the shore, follow the waterway
    to the end. There is my treasure.\n\nIf the highest can't help us, maybe you
    can handle it. Good luck, Terri.\r\n"
