  description: "Well.. That was an unfortunate. Is this the fabled land of Setheria?
    Is this even reality? Or have we ended up in the depths of darkness that is consuming
    us and all this is a dream? Are they alive? Am I alive?! I feel pain, my body
    is shaking... This is not an illusion! I refuse to accept my death! \n\nIn any
    case, I'm here and now, and I need to adapt to this world. I need to build a
    shelter to create my own sanctuary. I feel more danger in the air."
