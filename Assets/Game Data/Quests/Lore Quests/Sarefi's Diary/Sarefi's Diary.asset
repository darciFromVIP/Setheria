  label: The Mystery of the Heartstone
  description: 'I own a journal that talks about some kind of powerful Stones that
    play a big role in this world. According to the diary, a kind of vague energy
    circulates in them.


    I will also try to touch one and see what happens.

    Note
    text:

    It was indescribably exciting! Finally, my awaited moment came and
    I had the honor to touch the very soul of our world. The possibility to establish
    contact with him and communicate.


    These stones are a reflection of the
    life of our earth, and while I beat, let''s hope that the heart that keeps them
    alive with this eternal energy will be forever pure.


    I will hope that they
    heal the disaster that has been rumored lately.

    Ettein, soon you too will
    touch the Heartstone!
