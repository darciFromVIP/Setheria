  description: "I've found a letter from someone named Terri guiding me towards a
    potential treasure.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote
    text:\nIf anyone reads this letter, I'm probably no longer in this world. Everyone
    here is crazy! Everyone just fights each other, and that's only thanks to the
    abomination that consumes this world every day. Oh mighty Torrak, stop it before
    we lose control and damn our existence!\n\r\nWhoever will be reading this piece
    of paper, here is the key. It's not much, but I hid a chest in a safe place with
    some rare items that might help. The problem is that there are crabs in the place...
    Lots of frustrated crabs. But it should still be far from contagion.\r\n \r\nMove
    out of the village towards the stone pillar and follow the path across the bridge.
    Descend from the hill following the path towards the Aquatic biome. Stay close
    to the ancient trees and the shore, follow the waterway to the end. There is
    my treasure.\n\nIf the Highness can't help us, maybe you can handle it. Good
    luck.\n\n-Terri"
