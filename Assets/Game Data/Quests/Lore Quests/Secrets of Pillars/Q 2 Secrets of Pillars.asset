  description: 'I found that the pillars work as protection against the corruption
    that has invaded this world. I don''t know why, but I know how to prevent it.
    If I charge the pillar with energy, it should be able to protect the environment
    around it.


    All I have to do is create energy from some "blue crystal".
    I''m more than sure I''ve seen them before.'
