  description: 'I found another record, unfortunately there are also remains with
    it. Is that Ettein? Is it this infection that was eating him??


    Although
    I have only been here for a short time, I can clearly see how he is trying to
    get under my skin. I must continue his journey and complete it. Find out what
    the hell is going on here!


    Ettein...I will find what you were looking for
    so desperately.

    I''m so close! I can feel the pure miracle circulating deep in my
    veins, purifying me, but I can''t...

    consumes me in the process. Oh, Highness...why aren''t you here with us?? Someone
    please help me! I don''t want to die...'
