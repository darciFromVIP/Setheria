  description: '- Wild Creatures will attack your base every night starting from
    Day 1!

    - They will come in one wave from each nearby Cave, after you survived
    it, you can leave your base.

    - If you manage to defeat a Cave''s boss, it
    will collapse and stop spawning enemies. (Need to research an item for this)'
